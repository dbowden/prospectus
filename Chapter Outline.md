## 1. Introduction and Literature Review

- Research question
- Relation to existing literature on rebel cohesion
- Contribution to broader debates
- Normative and policy importance of explaining multi-rebel conflicts
- Overview of dissertation

## 2. Theoretical Framework

- Dissident network membership
- Dissident preferences
- Network ties and collective action
- Hypotheses
- External support and the dissident network
- Hypotheses

## 3. Research Design

- Spatial-temporal domain
- Description of ICEWS data
- Justification of network approach
- Network construction
- Modeling strategy

## 4. Network Structure and Violent Mobilization

- Hypotheses 1-4
- Panel models with number of active groups as DV
- Stochastic actor models with nodes as unit of analysis
- Discussion

## 5. External Networks and Spillover

- Hypotheses 5-8
- Panel models with dissident network attributes as DV
- Robustness: parallel temporal networks model
- Discussion

## 6. Qualitative Case Studies

- Objectives:
    + Determine whether proposed causal mechanism is responsible for cases that fit the theory
    + Explore discrepant, potentially falsifying cases
    + Expand temporal domain
    + Relax assumption that social ties collapse to a single dimension
- Criteria:
    + For testing the causal mechanism, cases should be consistent with the hypotheses (i.e. low network density/modularity, with a relatively large number of rebel groups)
    + Discrepant cases should have independent variables consistent with the hypotheses, but low values on the dependent variable (i.e. low network density/modularity, with a relatively large number of rebel groups)
- Candidate 1: One or more Burmese secessionist movements
    + Many internally divided movements, with varying dimensions of division - religion, communist/anti-communist, control of drug trade
        * Shared government opponent, colonial history, etc. would allow for controlled comparisons of these dimensions
    - Some cases with strong connection to outside states
    - Variation in number of violent groups both across cases and over time
    - Temporal domain: 1948-present
- Candidate 2: one or more non-secessionist cases
    + Cases that fit the theory - low density/modularity and high numbers of violent groups
- Candidate 3: one or more discrepant cases
    + Cases that do not fit the theory - low density/modularity, yet low numbers of violent groups
    + Assess whether these falsify the theory, or whether additional variables moderate influence of causal variables

## 7. Conclusion

- Summary of findings
- Explain implications for existing literature
- Policy implications
- Directions for future research
